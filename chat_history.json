So, in a nutshell, taking medication when you're ill is about giving your body extra tools to heal and get back to its healthy, happy self. \n\nAs for your other question, I'm afraid I don't understand the part about \"staring into space.\" Would you like me to explain the potential effects of smoking weed or cannabis? I can provide some general information about that if it's helpful! \n\nPlease remember, I'm your AI Health Buddy and not a medical professional.
